ðŸ“±Project Overview

This is a Kotlin-based Android application built with Jetpack Compose, following a clean MVVM architecture pattern. 
The project uses Koin for dependency injection and Ktor as the HTTP client. The app fetches a list of applications 
from a remote API, displays them in both a list and detail screen, caches them locally, and notifies users when new 
apps become available.
